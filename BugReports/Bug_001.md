**ID:** BUG-001  
**Date Found:** 2025-12-28  
**Environment:** macOS Tahoe 26.1 | Chrome v131.x | MacBook Pro (14-inch, Apple M3) | 3024×1964  
**Type:** UX / Usability  
**Severity:** S3 Minor

## Summary
After entering credentials and submitting the login form, the page scroll position jumps to the top instead of staying near the form.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to https://practice.expandtesting.com/login
2. Scroll so the login form is not at the very top of the viewport (e.g., mid-page)
3. Enter any username and password
4. Click **Login**

## Expected Result
The page should remain at the current scroll position (or keep the form in view) so the user can immediately see the result message.

## Actual Result
The page jumps to the top, moving the form and feedback area out of the user’s current view.
