## Summary
When login fails due to an invalid password, the error message is not prominent and is visually buried among surrounding ad content.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to https://practice.expandtesting.com/login
2. Enter a valid username and an invalid password
3. Click **Login**

## Expected Result
A clear, prominent error message appears near the form (or is styled to stand out) so the user immediately notices the failure reason.

## Actual Result
The error message is hard to notice because it is placed within or near multiple ad elements and does not stand out visually.
